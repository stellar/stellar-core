//! Core knows the leader schedule and tells the overlay which validators get
//! transactions now (the "targets", usually the leaders of the current and
//! the next round), or that there is no such list ("everyone": the INV/GETDATA
//! flood to all peers). The router keeps the transactions this node accepted
//! from its own Core until they are externalized, removed or expire, and
//! works out what has to be sent when one is added, when the targets change
//! and when a peer proves which validator it is.
//!
//! Transactions go directly (the body, without an advert) only when every
//! target is this node itself or a connected peer that identified itself.
//! Otherwise the node floods them as before, so that they reach every mempool
//! whatever the topology.
//!
//! Pure bookkeeping: no I/O, no clock of its own. The owner holds it in a
//! mutex that is never held across an await.
