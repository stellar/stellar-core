Installation Instructions
==================
These are instructions for building stellar-core from source.

For a potentially quicker set up, the following projects could be good alternatives:

* stellar-core in a [docker container](https://github.com/stellar/docker-stellar-core)
* stellar-core and [horizon](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/services/horizon) in a [docker container](https://github.com/stellar/docker-stellar-core-horizon)
* pre-compiled [packages](https://github.com/stellar/packages)

## Picking a version to run

Best is to use the latest *stable* release that can be downloaded from https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/releases


Alternatively, branches are organized in the following way:

| branch name | description | quality bar |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| master      | development branch | all unit tests passing |
| testnet     | version deployed to testnet | acceptance tests passing |
| prod        | version currently deployed on the live network | no recall class issue found in testnet and staging |

For convenience, we also keep a record in the form of release tags of the
 versions that make it to production:
 * pre-releases are versions that get deployed to testnet
 * releases are versions that made it all the way to production

## Containerized dev environment

We maintain a pre-configured Docker configuration ready for development with VSCode.

See the [dev container's README](.devcontainer/README.md) for more detail.

## Runtime dependencies

`stellar-core` does not have many dependencies.

If core was configured (see below) to work with Postgresql, a local Postgresql server
 will need to be deployed to the same host.

To install Postgresql, follow instructions from the [Postgresql download page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

## Build Dependencies

- c++ toolchain and headers that supports c++17
    - `clang` >= 10.0
    - `g++` >= 8.0
- `pkg-config`
- `bison` and `flex`
- `libpq-dev` unless you `./configure --disable-postgres` in the build step below.
- 64-bit system
- `clang-format-10` (for `make format` to work)
- `perl`
- `libunwind-dev`

### Ubuntu

#### Ubuntu 18.04
You can install the [test toolchain](#adding-the-test-toolchain) to build and run stellar-core with the latest version of the llvm toolchain.

Alternatively, if you want to just depend on stock Ubuntu, you will have to build with clang *and* have use `libc++` instead of `libstdc++` when compiling.

Ubuntu 18.04 has clang-10 available, that you can install with

    # install clang-10 toolchain
    sudo apt-get install clang-10

After installing packages, head to [building with clang and libc++](#building-with-clang-and-libc).


#### Adding the test toolchain (optional)
    # NOTE: newer version of the compilers are not
    #    provided by stock distributions
    #    and are provided by the /test toolchain
    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
    sudo apt-get update

#### Installing packages
    # common packages
    sudo apt-get install git build-essential pkg-config autoconf automake libtool bison flex libpq-dev libunwind-dev parallel
    # if using clang
    sudo apt-get install clang-10
    # clang with libstdc++
    sudo apt-get install gcc-8
    # if using g++ or building with libstdc++
    # sudo apt-get install gcc-8 g++-8 cpp-8

In order to make changes, you'll need to install the proper version of clang-format.

In order to install the llvm (clang) toolchain, you may have to follow instructions on https://apt.llvm.org/

    sudo apt-get install clang-format-10

### OS X
When building on OSX, here's some dependencies you'll need:
- Install xcode
- Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- `brew install libsodium`
- `brew install libtool`
- `brew install autoconf`
- `brew install automake`
- `brew install pkg-config`
- `brew install libpq` (required for postgres)
- `brew install openssl` (required for postgres)
- `brew install parallel` (required for running tests)
- `brew install ccache` (required for enabling ccache)
- `brew install bison` (the version that comes with the OS is too old)

You'll also need to configure pkg-config by adding the following to your shell (`.zshenv` or `.zshrc`):
```zsh
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:$(brew --prefix)/opt/libpq/lib/pkgconfig"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:$(brew --prefix)/opt/openssl@3/lib/pkgconfig"
export PATH="$(brew --prefix bison)/bin:$PATH"
```

### Windows
See [INSTALL-Windows.md](INSTALL-Windows.md)

## Basic Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core.git`
- `cd stellar-core`
- `git submodule init`
- `git submodule update`
- Type `./autogen.sh`.
- Type `./configure`   *(If configure complains about compiler versions, try `CXX=clang-10 ./configure` or `CXX=g++-8 ./configure` or similar, depending on your compiler.)*
- Type `make` or `make -j<N>` (where `<N>` is the number of parallel builds, a number less than the number of CPU cores available, e.g. `make -j3`)
- Type `make check` to run tests.
- Type `make install` to install.

## Building with clang and libc++

On some systems, building with `libc++`, [LLVM's version of the standard library](https://libcxx.llvm.org/) can be done instead of `libstdc++` (typically used on Linux).

NB: there are newer versions available of both clang and libc++, you will have to use the versions suited for your system.

You may need to install additional packages for this, for example, on Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with clang-10:

    # install libc++ headers
    sudo apt-get install libc++-10-dev libc++abi-10-dev

Here are sample steps to achieve this:

    export CC=clang-10
    export CXX=clang++-10
    export CFLAGS="-O3 -g1 -fno-omit-frame-pointer"
    export CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS -stdlib=libc++"
    git clone https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core.git
    cd stellar-core/
    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make -j6

## Building with Tracing

Configuring with `--enable-tracy` will build and embed the client component of the [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) high-resolution tracing system in the `stellar-core` binary.

The tracing client will activate automatically when stellar-core is running, and will listen for connections from Tracy servers (a command-line capture utility, or a cross-platform GUI).

The Tracy server components can also be compiled by configuring with `--enable-tracy-gui` or `--enable-tracy-capture`.

The GUI depends on the `capstone`, `freetype` and `glfw` libraries and their headers, and on linux or BSD the `GTK-2.0` libraries and headers. On Windows and MacOS, native toolkits are used instead.


    # On Ubuntu
    $ sudo apt-get install libcapstone-dev libfreetype6-dev libglfw3-dev libgtk2.0-dev

    # On MacOS
    $ brew install capstone freetype2 glfw

## Building with Rust

Configuring with `--enable-next-protocol-version-unsafe-for-production` will build and embed components written in the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) programming language. These components are currently only enabled when building the "next" protocol, not the "current" one.

Building the Rust components requires the `cargo` package manager and build system, as well as the `rustc` compiler, both version 1.63 or later.

Currently we recommend installing Rust using the Rust project's `rustup` installer, which can be found on [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

We also include a script in the repository `install-rust.sh` that downloads and runs a known version of `rustup` on x64-linux hosts, such as those used for CI and packaging.
