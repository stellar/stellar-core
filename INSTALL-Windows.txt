Installation Instructions
*************************

Build Dependencies
==================

- Download and install `Visual Studio 2015 RC` (for Visual C++) ; the Community Edition is free and fully functional.
       * https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/visual-studio-2015-downloads-vs.aspx

- Download and install PostgreSQL 9.4.1 from http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
  The default project file defines USE_POSTGRES and links against it.
       * Pick a directory for the database
       * Set an admin password for the database
       * Accept the default port (5432)
       * Accept `default` for the locale (not clear if anything depends on this. The `default` locale will presumably depend on your
         operating system's setting might cause inconsistencies)
       * Add `c:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.4\bin` to your PATH (else the binary will fail to start, not finding `libpq.dll`)
       *       If you install postgres in a different folder, you will have to update the project file in two places: "additional include locations" and "Linker input"

  If the installation fails, look into `%TEMP%\install-postgresql.log` for hints.


- In order to compile xdrc and run the binary you will need to either
       * Download and install MinGW from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
          * Add `C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin;C:\MinGW\bin` to the end of `%PATH%`
       * Download and install cygwin from https://cygwin.com/install.html
          * Get cygwin setup to install `Flex` and `Bison`
          * Add `c:\cygwin64\bin` to the end of `%PATH%`
          Note: if you're going to use 'cp'and 'mkdir' from cygwin (tests do),
                make sure that your install is correct by trying to copy a
                file from a `cmd.exe` console (not from a cygwin terminal).
                `cp in.txt out.txt` and then try to open *out.txt* with
                notepad. You should not get a permission denied error.
    Note: both MinGW and CygWin may run into virtual memory address space
    conflicts on modern versions of Windows. You will run into errors like
    `Couldn't reserve space for mingw's heap, Win32 error 0`.
    A workaround is to reboot until you can run `bison.exe` from a cmd.exe
    prompt.

- For making changes to the code, you should install the clang-format tool and Visual Studio extension, you can find both at http://llvm.org/builds/
