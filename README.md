Stellar-core is a replicated state machine that maintains a local copy of a cryptographic ledger and processes transactions against it, in consensus with a set of peers.
It implements the [Stellar Consensus Protocol](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/src/scp/readme.md), a _federated_ consensus protocol.
It is written in C++17 and runs on Linux, OSX and Windows.
