## The following options should probably never be set. They are used primarily
##  for testing.

# RUN_STANDALONE (true or false) defaults to false
# This is a mode for testing. It prevents you from trying to connect
#  to other peers
RUN_STANDALONE=false


# INVARIANT_CHECKS (list of strings) default is empty
# Setting this will cause specified invariants to be checked on ledger close and
# on bucket apply.
# Strings specified are matched (as regex) against the list of invariants.
# For example, to enable all invariants use ".*"
# List of invariants:
# - "AccountSubEntriesCountIsValid"
#     Setting this will cause additional work on each operation apply - it
#     checks if the change in the number of subentries of account (signers +
#     offers + data + trustlines) equals the change in the value numsubentries
#     store in account. This check is only performed for accounts modified in
#     any way in given ledger.
#     The overhead may cause slower systems to not perform as fast as the rest
#     of the network, caution is advised when using this.
# - "BucketListIsConsistentWithDatabase"
#     Setting this will cause additional work on each bucket apply - it checks a
#     variety of properties that should be satisfied by an applied bucket, for
#     detailed information about what is checked see the comment in the header
#     invariant/BucketListIsConsistentWithDatabase.h.
#     The overhead may cause a system to catch-up more than once before being
#     in sync with the network.
# - "CacheIsConsistentWithDatabase"
#     Setting this will cause additional work on each operation apply - it
#     checks if internal cache of ledger entries is consistent with content of
#     database. It is equivalent to PARANOID_MODE from older versions of
#     stellar-core.
#     The overhead may cause slower systems to not perform as fast as the rest
#     of the network, caution is advised when using this.
# - "ConservationOfLumens"
#     Setting this will cause additional work on each operation apply - it
#     checks that the total number of lumens only changes during inflation.
#     The overhead may cause slower systems to not perform as fast as the rest
#     of the network, caution is advised when using this.
# - "LedgerEntryIsValid"
#     Setting this will cause additional work on each operation apply - it
#     checks a variety of properties that must be true for a LedgerEntry to be
#     valid.
#     The overhead may cause slower systems to not perform as fast as the rest
#     of the network, caution is advised when using this.
# - "LiabilitiesMatchOffers"
#     Setting this will cause additional work on each operation apply - it
#     checks that accounts, trust lines, and offers satisfy all constraints
#     associated with liabilities. For additional information, see the comment
#     in the header invariant/LiabilitiesMatchOffers.h.
#     The overhead may cause slower systems to not perform as fast as the rest
#     of the network, caution is advised when using this.

# MANUAL_CLOSE (true or false) defaults to false
# Mode for testing. Ledger will only close when stellar-core gets
#  the `manualclose` command
MANUAL_CLOSE=false


# ARTIFICIALLY_GENERATE_LOAD_FOR_TESTING (true or false) defaults to false
# Enables synthetic load generation on demand.
# The load is triggered by the `generateload` runtime command.
# This option only exists for stress-testing and should not be enabled in
#  production networks.
ARTIFICIALLY_GENERATE_LOAD_FOR_TESTING=false


# ARTIFICIALLY_ACCELERATE_TIME_FOR_TESTING (true or false) defaults to false
# Reduces ledger close time to 1s and checkpoint frequency to every 8 ledgers.
# Do not ever set this in production, as it will make your history archives
#   incompatible with those of anyone else.
ARTIFICIALLY_ACCELERATE_TIME_FOR_TESTING=false

# ARTIFICIALLY_SET_CLOSE_TIME_FOR_TESTING (in seconds), defaults to no override
# Overrides the close time to the specified value but does not change checkpoint
# frequency - this may cause network instability.
# Do not use in production.
ARTIFICIALLY_SET_CLOSE_TIME_FOR_TESTING=0

# ALLOW_LOCALHOST_FOR_TESTING defaults to false
# Allows to connect to localhost, should not be enabled on production systems
# as this is a security threat.
ALLOW_LOCALHOST_FOR_TESTING=false

# MAXIMUM_LEDGER_CLOSETIME_DRIFT (in seconds) defaults to 50
# Maximum drift between the local clock and the network time.
# When joining the network for the first time, ignore SCP messages that are
# unlikely to be for the latest ledger.
MAXIMUM_LEDGER_CLOSETIME_DRIFT=50

# DISABLE_XDR_FSYNC (true or false) defaults to false.
# If set to true, writing an XDR file (a bucket or a checkpoint) will not
# be followed by an fsync on the file. This in turn means that XDR files
# (which hold the canonical state of the ledger) may be corrupted if the
# operating system suddenly crashes or loses power, causing the node to
# diverge and get stuck on restart, or potentially even publish bad
# history. This option only exists as an escape hatch if the local
# filesystem is so unusably slow that you prefer operating without
# durability guarantees. Do not set it to true unless you're very certain
# you want to make that trade.
DISABLE_XDR_FSYNC=false

# MAX_SLOTS_TO_REMEMBER (in ledgers) defaults to 12
# Most people should leave this to 12
# Number of most recent ledgers keep in memory. Storing more ledgers allows other
# nodes to join the network without catching up. This is useful for simulation
# testing purposes.
MAX_SLOTS_TO_REMEMBER=12

# METADATA_OUTPUT_STREAM defaults to "", disabling it.
# A string specifying a stream to write fine-grained metadata to for each ledger
# close while running. This will be opened at startup and synchronously
# streamed-to during both catchup and live ledger-closing.
#
# Streams may be specified either as a pathname (typically a named FIFO on POSIX
# or a named pipe on Windows, though plain files also work) or a string of the
# form "fd:N" for some integer N which, on POSIX, specifies the existing open
# file descriptor N inherited by the process (for example to write to an
# anonymous pipe).
#
# As a further safety check, this option is mutually exclusive with
# NODE_IS_VALIDATOR, as its typical use writing to a pipe with a reader process
# on the other end introduces a potentially-unbounded synchronous delay in
# closing a ledger, and should not be used on a node participating in consensus,
# only a passive "watcher" node.
METADATA_OUTPUT_STREAM=""

# EXCLUDE_TRANSACTIONS_CONTAINING_OPERATION_TYPE (list of strings) default is empty
# Setting this will cause the node to reject transactions that it receives if
# they contain any operation in this list. It will not, however, stop the node
# from voting for or applying such transactions.
#
# Strings specified are matched against the names of values for OperationType,
# such as "CREATE_ACCOUNT" or "PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND".

#            grouped together; the threshold used assumes a simple majority (2f+1)
#    entities are grouped by QUALITY
#    groups are nested such that the group for the quality that precedes a given group
#            is added as a backup for the higher quality group.
#            ie: at top level group contains HIGH quality entities and the group that
#              contains MEDIUM quality entities
#    heterogeneous groups use a threshold assuming byzantine failure (3f+1)
#

# Individual validators can be added in standard form
# NAME: string (required) unique identifier to use to identify a validator
#       NAME is added as an alias for PUBLIC_KEY
# QUALITY: string (required*) quality of validator

# Any place you can save and load static files from should be usable by the

# Simply use template parameters `{0}` and `{1}` in place of the files being transmitted or retrieved.
# You can specify multiple places to store and fetch from. stellar-core will
# use multiple fetching locations as backup in case there is a failure fetching from one.
#
# Note: any archive you *put* to you must run `$ stellar-core new-hist <historyarchive>`
#       once before you start.
#       for example this config you would run: $ stellar-core new-hist local

# QUORUM_SET (optional)
# This is how you specify this server's quorum set manually
#
#  *** this section is for advanced users and exists mostly for historical reasons ***
#    the preferred way to configure your quorum set is to use instead [[VALIDATORS]]
#
# It can be nested up to 2 levels: {A,B,C,{D,E,F},{G,H,{I,J,K,L}}}
# THRESHOLD_PERCENT is how many have to agree (1-100%) within a given set.
# Each set is treated as one vote.
# So for example in the above there are 5 things that can vote:
# individual validators: A,B,C, and the sets {D,E,F} and {G,H with subset {I,J,K,L}}
# the sets each have their own threshold.
# For example with {100% G,H with subset (50% I,J,K,L}}
#   means that quorum will be met with G, H and any 2 (50%) of {I, J, K, L}
#
# a [QUORUM_SET.path] section is constructed as
# THRESHOLD_PERCENT: how many have to agree, defaults to 67 (rounds up).
# VALIDATORS: array of node IDs
# additional subsets [QUORUM_SET.path.item_number]
# a QUORUM_SET
#  must not contain duplicate entries {{A,B},{A,C}} is invalid for example
#  The key for "self" is implicitely added at the top level, so the effective
#   quorum set is [t:2, self, QUORUM_SET]. Note that "self" is always agreeing
#   with the instance (if QUORUM_SET includes it)
#
# The following setup is equivalent to the example given above.
