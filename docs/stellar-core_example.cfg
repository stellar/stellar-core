## General admin settings


# LOG_FILE_PATH (string) default "stellar-core.log"
# Path to the file you want stellar-core to write its log to.
# You can set to "" for no log file.
LOG_FILE_PATH=""

# TMP_DIR_PATH (string) default "tmp"
# Specifies the directory where stellar-core should store its temporary files.
TMP_DIR_PATH="tmp"


# BUCKET_DIR_PATH (string) default "buckets"
# Specifies the directory where stellar-core should store the bucket list.
# This will get written to a lot and will grow as the size of the ledger grows.
BUCKET_DIR_PATH="buckets"


# DATABASE (string) default "sqlite3://:memory:"
# Sets the DB connection string for SOCI.
# Defaults to an in memory database.
# If using sqlite, a string like:
#
#   "sqlite3://path/to/dbname.db"
#
# alternatively, if using postgresql, a string like:
#
#   "postgresql://dbname=stellar user=xxxx password=yyyy host=10.0.x.y"
#
# taking any combination of parameters from:
#
#   http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS

DATABASE="sqlite3://stellar.db"


# HTTP_PORT (integer) default 11626
# What port stellar-core listens for commands on.
HTTP_PORT=11626

# PUBLIC_HTTP_PORT (true or false) default false
# If false you only accept stellar commands from localhost. 
# Do not set to true and expose the port to the open internet. This will allow 
#  random people to run stellar commands on your server. (such as `stop`)
PUBLIC_HTTP_PORT=false

# COMMANDS  (list of strings) default is empty
# List of commands to run on startup.
# Right now only setting log levels really makes sense.

##  SCP settings

# NODE_SEED (string) default random, regenerated each run.
# The seed defining the identity of this node in SCP.
# Your seed should be unique. Protect your seed. Treat it like a password.
# If you don't set a NODE_SEED one will be generated for you randomly
# on each startup.
#
# To generate a new, stable seed (and associated public key), run:
#
#  stellar-core --genseed
#
# You only need to keep the seed from this; you can always recover the
# public key from the seed by running:
#
#  stellar-core --convertid <seed>
#
NODE_SEED="SBI3CZU7XZEWVXU7OZLW5MMUQAP334JFOPXSLTPOH43IRTEQ2QYXU5RG"

# NODE_IS_VALIDATOR (boolean) default false.
# Only nodes that want to participate in SCP should set NODE_IS_VALIDATOR=true.
# Most instances should operate in observer mode with NODE_IS_VALIDATOR=false.
# See QUORUM_SET below.
NODE_IS_VALIDATOR=false

# DESIRED_BASE_FEE (integer) default 100
# This is what you would prefer the base fee to be. It is in stroops.
DESIRED_BASE_FEE=100

# DESIRED_BASE_RESERVE (integer) default 100000000
# This is what you prefer the base reserve to be. It is in stroops.
DESIRED_BASE_RESERVE=100000000

# DESIRED_MAX_TX_PER_LEDGER (integer) default 500
# This is how many maximum transactions per ledger you would like to process.
# Note that the actual MAX_TX_PER_LEDGER is decided during consensus and can
# be lower/higher by up to 30%.
# * The instance picks the top MAX_TX_PER_LEDGER transactions locally to be
#   considered in the next ledger. Where transactions are ordered by
#   transaction fee (lower fee transactions are held for later).
# * The instance will consider transaction sets coming from other peers that
#   have more transactions invalid.
DESIRED_MAX_TX_PER_LEDGER=400

# FAILURE_SAFETY (integer) default 1
# This is the number of failures you want to be able to tolerate.
# You will need at least 3f+1 nodes in your quorum set.
# If you don't have enough in your quorum set to tolerate the level you 
#  set here stellar-core won't run.
FAILURE_SAFETY=1

# UNSAFE_QUORUM (true or false) default false
# If set to true allows you to specify an unsafe quorum set. 
# Otherwise it won't start if you have your threshold % set too low.
# You might want to set this if you are running your own network and 
#  aren't concerned with byzantine failures.
UNSAFE_QUORUM=false


#########################
##  History


# CATCHUP_COMPLETE (true or false) defaults to false
# if true will catchup to the network "completely" (replaying all history)
# if false will catchup "minimally", using deltas to the most recent snapshot.
CATCHUP_COMPLETE=false

# MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBPROCESSES (integer) default 8
# History catchup can potentialy spawn a bunch of sub-processes.
# This limits the number that will be active at a time.
MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBPROCESSES=10



# See HISTORY table at below



###############################
## The following options should probably never be set. They are used primarily 
##  for testing.

# RUN_STANDALONE (true or false) defaults to false
# This is a mode for testing. It prevents you from trying to connect 
#  to other peers
RUN_STANDALONE=false

# PARANOID_MODE (true or false) defaults to false
# Setting this will cause all sorts of extra checks to occur.
# the overhead may cause slower systems to not perform as fast as the rest
#   of the network, caution is advised when using this.
PARANOID_MODE=false


# MANUAL_CLOSE (true or false) defaults to false
# Mode for testing. Ledger will only close when stellar-core gets 
#  the `manualclose` command  
MANUAL_CLOSE=false


# ARTIFICIALLY_GENERATE_LOAD_FOR_TESTING (true or false) defaults to false
# Enables synthetic load generation on demand.
# The load is triggered by the `generateload` runtime command.
# This option only exists for stress-testing and should not be enabled in
#  production networks.
ARTIFICIALLY_GENERATE_LOAD_FOR_TESTING=false


# ARTIFICIALLY_ACCELERATE_TIME_FOR_TESTING (true or false) defaults to false
# Reduces ledger close time to 1s and checkpoint frequency to every 8 ledgers.
# Do not ever set this in production, as it will make your history archives 
#   incompatible with those of anyone else.
ARTIFICIALLY_ACCELERATE_TIME_FOR_TESTING=false

##  Tables must come at the end. (TOML you are almost perfect!)

# HISTORY 
# Used to specify where to fetch and store the history archives.
# Fetching and storing history is kept as general as possible. 
# Any place you can save and load static files from should be usable by the 
#  stellar-core history system.   s3, the file system, http, etc
# stellar-core will call any external process you specify and will pass it the 
#  name of the file to save or load.
# Simply use template parameters `{0}` and `{1}` in place of the files being transmitted or retrieved.
# You can specify multiple places to store and fetch from. stellar-core will 
# use multiple fetching locations as backup in case there is a failure fetching from one.

# QUORUM_SET (object see below) default is empty
# This is how you specify this server's quorom set.
# It can be nested 2 levels: (A,B,C,(D,E,F),(G,H,(I,J,K,L)))
# The THRESHOLD_PERCENT is how many have to agree. The sets are treated 
# as one vote. So for example in the above there are 5 things that can vote: 
# individual validators: A,B,C and sets (D,E,F) and set (G,H with subset (I,J,K,L))
# the sets each have their own threshold.
# This allows you to for example, treat 3 servers of some entity as one vote 
#  but you only need to hear from 2 of them.
# THRESHOLD_PERCENT defaults to 67.
# The following setup is equivalent to the example given above.
