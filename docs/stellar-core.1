.PP
stellar\-core \- Core daemon for Stellar payment network
.SH SYNOPSYS
.PP
stellar\-core [OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Stellar is a decentralized, federated peer\-to\-peer network that allows
people to send payments in any asset anywhere in the world
instantaneously, and with minimal fee.
\f[C]Stellar\-core\f[] is the core component of this network.
\f[C]Stellar\-core\f[] is a C++ implementation of the Stellar Consensus
Protocol configured to construct a chain of ledgers that are guaranteed
to be in agreement across all the participating nodes at all times.
.SS Configuration file
.PP
In most modes of operation, stellar\-core requires a configuration file.
By default, it looks for a file called \f[C]stellar\-core.cfg\f[] in the
current working directory, but this default can be changed by the
\f[C]\-\-conf\f[] command\-line option.
The configuration file is in TOML syntax.
The full set of supported directives can be found in
\f[C]/usr/local/share/doc/stellar\-core_example.cfg\f[].
.SS Common options
.PP
Common options can be placed at any place in the command line.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\-\-conf \f[]: Specify a config file to use.
You can use \[aq]\-\[aq] and provide the config file via STDIN.
\f[I]default \[aq]stellar\-core.cfg\[aq]\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\-\-ll \f[]: Set the log level.
It is redundant with \f[C]http\-command\ ll\f[] but we need this form if
you want to change the log level during test runs.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\-\-metric \f[]: Report metric METRIC on exit.
Used for gathering a metric cumulatively during a test run.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\-\-help\f[]: Show help message for given command.
.SS Command line options
.PP
Command options can only by placed after command.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]catchup <DESTINATION\-LEDGER/LEDGER\-COUNT>\f[]: Perform catchup
from history archives without connecting to network.
For new instances (with empty history tables \- only ledger 1 present in
the database) it will respect LEDGER\-COUNT configuration and it will
perform bucket application on such a checkpoint that at least
LEDGER\-COUNT entries are present in history table afterwards.
For instances that already have some history entries, all ledgers since
last closed ledger will be replayed.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]check\-quorum\f[]: Check quorum intersection from history to ensure
there is closure over all the validators in the network.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]convert\-id \f[]: Will output the passed ID in all known forms and
then exit.
Useful for determining the public key that corresponds to a given
private key.
For example:
.PP
\f[C]$\ stellar\-core\ convert\-id\ SDQVDISRYN2JXBS7ICL7QJAEKB3HWBJFP2QECXG7GZICAHBK4UNJCWK2\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]dump\-xdr \f[]: Dumps the given XDR file and then exits.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]force\-scp\f[]: This command is used to start a network from
scratch or when a network has lost quorum because of failed nodes or
otherwise.
It sets a flag in the database.
The next time stellar\-core is run, stellar\-core will start emitting
SCP messages based on its last known ledger.
Without this flag stellar\-core waits to hear a ledger close from the
network before starting SCP. force\-scp doesn\[aq]t change the
requirements for quorum so although this node will emit SCP messages SCP
won\[aq]t complete until there are also a quorum of other nodes also
emitting SCP messages on this same ledger.
Value of force\-scp can be reset with \-\-reset flag.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]fuzz \f[]: Run a single fuzz input and exit.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]gen\-fuzz \f[]: Generate a random fuzzer input file.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]gen\-seed\f[]: Generate and print a random public/private key and
then exit.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]help\f[]: Print the available command line options and then exit..
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]http\-command \f[] Send an HTTP command (#http-commands) to an
already running local instance of stellar\-core and then exit.
For example:
.PP
\f[C]$\ stellar\-core\ http\-command\ info\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]infer\-quorum\f[]: Print a potential quorum set inferred from
history.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]load\-xdr \f[]: Load an XDR bucket file, for testing.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]new\-db\f[]: Clears the local database and resets it to the genesis
ledger.
If you connect to the network after that it will catch up from scratch.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]new\-hist ...\f[]: Initialize the named history archives
HISTORY\-LABEL.
HISTORY\-LABEL should be one of the history archives you have specified
in the stellar\-core.cfg.
This will write a \f[C]\&.well\-known/stellar\-history.json\f[] file in
the archive root.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]offline\-info\f[]: Returns an output similar to
\f[C]\-\-c\ info\f[] for an offline instance
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]print\-xdr \f[]: Pretty\-print a binary file containing an XDR
object.
If FILE\-NAME is "\-", the XDR object is read from standard input.
Option \-\-filetype
[auto|ledgerheader|meta|result|resultpair|tx|txfee]** controls type used
for printing (default: auto). Option \-\-base64 alters the behavior to
work on base64\-encoded XDR rather than raw XDR.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]publish\f[]: Execute publish of all items remaining in publish
queue without connecting to network.
May not publish last checkpoint if last closed ledger is on checkpoint
boundary.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]report\-last\-history\-checkpoint\f[]: Download and report last
history checkpoint from a history archive.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]run\f[]: Runs stellar\-core service.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]sec\-to\-pub\f[]: Reads a secret key on standard input and outputs
the corresponding public key.
Both keys are in Stellar\[aq]s standard base\-32 ASCII format.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]sign\-transaction \f[]: Add a digital signature to a transaction
envelope stored in binary format in , and send the result to standard
output (which should be redirected to a file or piped through a tool
such as \f[C]base64\f[]).
The private signing key is read from standard input, unless is "\-" in
which case the transaction envelope is read from standard input and the
signing key is read from \f[C]/dev/tty\f[].
In either event, if the signing key appears to be coming from a
terminal, stellar\-core disables echo.
Note that if you do not have a STELLAR_NETWORK_ID environment variable,
then before this argument you must specify the \-\-netid option.
For example, the production stellar network is
"\f[C]Public\ Global\ Stellar\ Network\ ;\ \ \ September\ 2015\f[]"
while the test network is
"\f[C]Test\ SDF\ Network\ ;\ September\ \ \ 2015\f[]". Option \-\-base64
alters the behavior to work on base64\-encoded XDR rather than raw XDR.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]test\f[]: Run all the unit tests.
.IP \[bu] 2
Suboptions specific to stellar\-core:
.RS 2

\f[C]\-\-all\-versions\f[] : run with all possible protocol versions
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-version\ <N>\f[] : run tests for protocol version N, can be
specified multiple times (default latest)
.IP \[bu] 2

info (https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/command-line.md)
on possible options for test.
.IP \[bu] 2
For example this will run just the tests tagged with \f[C][tx]\f[] using
protocol versions 9 and 10 and stop after the first failure:
\f[C]stellar\-core\ test\ \-a\ \-\-version\ 9\ \-\-version\ 10\ "[tx]"\f[]
