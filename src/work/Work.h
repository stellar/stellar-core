/** Class 'Work' (and its friends 'WorkManager' and 'WorkParent') support
 * structured dispatch of async or long-running activities that:
 *
 *  - May depend on other Work before starting
 *  - May have parts that can run in parallel, other parts in serial
 *  - May need to be broken into steps, so as not to block the main thread
 *  - May fail and need to retry, after some delay
 *
 * Formerly this was managed through ad-hoc sprinkled-through-the-code
 * copies of each of these facets of work-management. 'Work' is an attempt
 * to make those facets uniform, systematic, and out-of-the-way of the
 * logic of each piece of work.
