/**
 * Work is an extension of BasicWork which additionally manages children.
 * This allows the following:
 *
 *  - Work might be dependent on the state of its children before
 *    performing its duties.
 *
 *  - Work may have children that are independent and could run in
 *    parallel, or dispatch children serially.
 *
 *  It's worth noting that now since crank calls are propagated down the
 *  tree from the work scheduler, implementations should aim to create
 *  flatter structures for better efficiency; they can use WorkSequence
 *  if a long serial order needs to be enforced.
