 * testing by simulating a network of applications.
 *
 * Owns two asio::io_services, one "main" (driven by the main thread) and one
 * "worker" (driven by a pool of #NCORE worker threads). The main io_service
 * has the run of the application and responds to the majority of (small,
 * sequential, consensus-related) network requests. The worker
 * threads/io_service are for long-running, self-contained helper jobs such as
 * bulk transfers and hashing. They should not touch anything outside their own
 * job-state (i.e. in a closure) and should post results back to the main
 * io_service when complete.

    //    of parties based on our _current_ config-file quorum-set".
    //    This definition may change from run to run. This is intentional.
    //    Trust is not permanent, may need to be reinforced by some
    //    other party if we stop trusting someone we trusted in the past.
    //
    //  - Catching-up means: the newest trusted ledger we have on hand has a
    //    sequence number less than the highest "previous-ledger" sequence
    //    number we hear in ballots from any of our quorum-sets. In other
    //    words, we don't have the prestate necessary to run consensus
    //    transactions against yet, even if we wanted to.
    //
    //  - We only ever execute a transaction set when it's part of a
    //    trusted ledger. Currently trusted, not historical trusted.
    //    This includes the current consensus round: we don't run the
    //    transactions at all until we're certain everyone agrees on them.
    //
    //  - We only ever place our signature on a ledger when we have executed
    //    the transactions ourselves and verified the outcome. Even if we
    //    trust someone else's signatures for the sake of constructing a
    //    ledger (say, from snapshots), we don't _add our own signature_
    //    without execution as well.
