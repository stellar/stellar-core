/*
 * State of a single instance of the stellar-core application.
 *
 * Multiple instances may exist in the same process, eg. for the sake of testing
 * by simulating a network of Applications.
 *
 *
 * Clocks, time and events
 * -----------------------
 *
 * An Application is connected to a VirtualClock, that both manages the
 * Application's view of time and also owns an IO event loop that dispatches
 * events for the main thread. See VirtualClock for details.
 *
 * In order to advance an Application's view of time, as well as dispatch any IO
 * events, timers or callbacks, the associated VirtualClock must be cranked. See
 * VirtualClock::crank().
 *
 * All Applications coordinating on a simulation should be bound to the same
 * VirtualClock, so that their view of time advances from event to event within
 * the collective simulation.
 *
 *
 * Configuration
 * -------------
 *
 * Each Application owns a Config object, which describes any user-controllable
 * configuration variables, including cryptographic keys, network ports, log
 * files, directories and the like. A local copy of the Config object is made on
 * construction of each Application, after which the local copy cannot be
 * further altered; the Application should be destroyed and recreted if any
 * change to configuration is desired.
 *
 *
 * Subsystems
 * ----------
 *
 * Each Application owns a collection of subsystem "manager" objects, typically
 * one per subdirectory in the source tree. For example, the LedgerManager, the
 * OverlayManager, the HistoryManager, etc. Instances of these subsystem objects
 * are generally created in 1:1 correspondence with their owning Application;
 * each Application creates a new LedgerManager for itself, for example.
 *
 * Each subsystem object contains a reference back to its owning Application,
 *and
 * uses this reference to retrieve its Application's associated instance of the
 * other subsystems. So for example an Application's LedgerManager can access
 * that Application's HistoryManager in order to run catchup. Subsystems access
 * one another through virtual interfaces, to afford some degree of support for
 * testing and information hiding.
 *
 *
 * Threading
 * ---------
 *
 * In general, Application expects to run on a single thread -- the main thread
 * -- and most subsystems perform no locking, are not multi-thread
 * safe. Operations with high IO latency are broken into steps and executed
 * piecewise through the VirtualClock's asio::io_service; those with high CPU
 * latency are run on a "worker" thread pool.
 *
 * Each Application owns a secondary "worker" asio::io_service, that queues and
 * dispatches CPU-bound work to a number of worker threads (one per core); these
 * serve only to offload self-contained CPU-bound tasks like hashing from the
 * main thread, and do not generally call back into the Application's owned
 * sub-objects (with a couple exceptions, in the BucketManager and BucketList
 * objects).
 *
 * Completed "worker" tasks typically post their results back to the main
 * thread's io_service (held in the VirtualClock), or else deliver their results
 * to the Application through std::futures or similar standard
 * thread-synchronization primitives.
