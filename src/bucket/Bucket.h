/**
 * Bucket is an immutable container for a sorted set of "Entries" (object ID,
 * hash, xdr-message tuples) which is designed to be held in a shared_ptr<>
 * which is referenced between threads, to minimize copying. It is therefore
 * imperative that it be _really_ immutable, not just faking it.
 *
 * Two buckets can be merged together efficiently (in a single pass): elements
 * from the newer bucket overwrite elements from the older bucket, the rest are
 * merged in sorted order, and all elements are hashed while being added.
