/**
 * @class Tracker
 *
 * Asks peers for given data set. If a peer does not have given data set,
 * asks another one. If no peer does have given data set, it starts again
 * with new set of peers (possibly overlapping, as peers may learned about
 * this data set in meantime).
 *
 * For asking a AskPeer delegate is used.
 *
 * Tracker keeps list of envelopes that requires given data set to be
 * fully resolved. When data is received each envelope is resend to Herder
 * so it can check if it has all required data and then process envelope.
 * @see listen(Peer::pointer) is used to add envelopes to that list.
