/**
 * OverlayManager maintains a virtual broadcast network, consisting of a set of
 * remote TCP peers (TCPPeer), a mechanism for flooding messages to all peers
 * (FloodGate), and a mechanism for sending and receiving anycast request/reply
 * pairs (ItemFetcher).
 *
 * Overlay network messages are defined as the XDR structure type
 * `StellarMessage`, in the file src/xdr/Stellar-overlay.x
 *
 * They are minimally framed using the Record Marking (RM) standard of RFC5531
 * (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5531#page-16) and the RM-framed messages are
 * transmitted over TCP/IP sockets, between peers.
 *
 * The `StellarMessage` union contains 3 logically distinct kinds of message:
 *
 *  - Messages directed to or from a specific peer, with or without a response:
 *    HELLO, GET_PEERS, PEERS, DONT_HAVE, ERROR_MSG
 *
 *  - One-way broadcast messages informing other peers of an event:
 *    TRANSACTION and SCP_MESSAGE
 *
 *  - Two-way anycast messages requesting a value (by hash) or providing it:
 *    GET_TX_SET, TX_SET, GET_SCP_QUORUMSET, SCP_QUORUMSET, GET_SCP_STATE
 *
 * Anycasts are initiated and serviced two instances of ItemFetcher
 * (mTxSetFetcher and mQuorumSetFetcher). Anycast messages are sent to
 * directly-connected peers, in sequence until satisfied. They are not
 * flooded between peers.
 *
 * Broadcasts are initiated by the Herder and sent to both the Herder _and_ the
 * local FloodGate, for propagation to other peers.
 *
 * The OverlayManager tracks its known peers in the Database and shares peer
 * records with other peers when asked.
