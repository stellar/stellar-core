// For background and diagram context on what the orderbook even _means_, take

// We'll use an ASCII-art reproduction of the diagram in that document to

//                      Willing to sell more wheat at higher sale price
//
//
// So far so good? Ok, now let's talk about the more-detailed semantics of the
// orders we support!
//
//
// Limit orders, exact orders, and price selection
// -----------------------------------------------
//
// Orders/Offers (see terminology in link above) submitted to the system are
// actually _limit_ offers, meaning that a new order will match against any
// stored offer in the book offering the seller a _higher_ price for their merch
// as well, just not a _lower_ one. So in the diagram above, for example, if
// someone submits an offer to sell sheep at a "cheap" 15 wheat per sheep price,
// then the cheapest wheat at the top of the wheat-selling stack (that priced at
// 20 wheat per sheep, i.e. paying the sheep-seller _more_) still matches the
// new offer and sells, even though the sheep-seller was willing to sell sheep
// for less. An offer for a higher price was already present, and the limit
// order on the sheep sale only bounds the price below (and amount above). It
// will take the higher price too, better for the seller!
//
// What price is the sale made at? The price of the offer stored in the book. In
// fact, offers _in the book_ are not limit offers, they are _exact_ offers that
// attempt to cross _at the price written on them_, never anything else (subject
// to rounding error, see below). So in the previous example, the exchange would
// occur at a rate of 0.05 sheep per wheat (or 20 wheat per sheep), because that
// price is in the exact-priced offer-to-sell in the book, not the newly
// submitted limit offer that's crossing it.
//
// The logic for this is in the loop `convertWithOffers`, in which _existing_
// offers are repeatedly loaded from the database and then passed to
// `crossOfferV10`, which calls `exchangeV10` to actually transfer assets, using
// the price in the crossed (stored) offer. There's a lot more (very well
// commented!) complexity in `exchangeV10` to ensure fairness of rounding and
// calculating the symmetric difference, but the price choice is the concern to
// understand here.
//
//
// Alternating price advantages / use of limits
// --------------------------------------------
//
// Returning to our example and going one step further: imagine that
// newly-submitted offer (posted against the diagram) was trying to sell a
// _higher quantity_ than it can sell at _its_ limit price -- say that sheep
// seller wanted to sell 2 sheep at 15 wheat per sheep. Again, that's 0.0666
// sheep per wheat so it's going to cross the cheapest offer selling wheat at
// only 0.05 sheep per wheat. But 2 sheep covers more wheat than is for sale at
// either price: it's enough to buy 30 wheat at 0.0666 and _40_ wheat at
// 0.05. But only 25 is for sale at any price less than 0.1. So the 25 wheat for
// sale will be exchanged (at 0.05 per sheep) for 1.25 sheep, and the remaining
// 0.75 sheep for sale will be written into the order book at 0.0666. In this
// way, the "price advantage" we gave the sheep-seller when crossing -- giving
// them the use of a limit order -- will be reversed in the subsequent exchange,
// if the wheat seller returns to the market with more wheat to sell: they can
// put their own limit order in at 0.05 and still take the better 0.0666 sheep
// per wheat price that the residual 0.75 sheep are waiting to sell at.
//
//
// "Buying" too much, and CAP-0006
// -------------------------------
//
// Returning to our example one more time: imagine that the sheep-seller was
// really more interested in acquiring a specific quantity of wheat than they
// were in selling sheep. They have lots of sheep. But they want to "buy" (say)
// exactly 10 wheat. Can they do this? Our system only deals in sell offers, so
// they convert their interest to "buy" 10 wheat into a sell offer at a number
// that reflects their last accurate knowledge of the market, let's say 0.0666
// sheep per wheat, and offer to sell 0.666 sheep at that price (to get their 10
// wheat, which is what they _want_).
//
// Unfortunately that then crosses with the wheat-seller's offer of 25 wheat @
// 0.05 sheep per wheat and gets them more wheat than they wanted! They get 12
// wheat, and the transaction used up all the sheep they were selling; whereas
// they _wanted_ the matching engine to see the 25 wheat at 0.05 and sell them
// the desired 10 wheat for 0.5 sheep. This phenomenon -- of not being able to
// bound the amount you "buy" because you have to express it as a "sell" -- is
// what motivates CAP-0006. Specifically it happens because crossing attempts to
// sell _all_ of the quantity for sale (offer.amount = 0.6 sheep) rather than as
// little as necessary (at the crossing price) to get the _implicit_ desired
// amount of the _other_ asset (offer.amount / offer.price = 10 wheat).
//
// CAP-0006 therefore adds a new _operation_ type that posts a real honest to
// goodness _buy_ offer, and attempts to cross it. There are two possible
// outcomes: if it is executable in full, then the exchange occurs and the
// crossed offer in the order book is decreased appropriately. If it is _not_
// executable in full, then _part_ of the "buy" is executed (as much as can be)
// and the remainder is converted to a sell offer and stored in the order book,
// as would have been the case before CAP-0006. The reason this is ok is that
// this residue is by definition _not crossing_ with anything in the book -- the
// crossing part just got annihilated -- so (based on the "price selection"
// criteria above) it is setting the _exact_ price at which it will cross in the
// future. When someone else crosses it in the future, they will not buy more of
// what it's selling than it actually wants to sell.
//
//
// Rounding error
// --------------
//
// The discussion so far has used carefully chosen prices and amounts that don't
// cause big rounding errors. It is however quite possible to have a price and
// quantity exchanged in such a way that the division causes a very different
// _effective price_ than the supposedly-exact one written on a (non-limit)
// order stored in the book.
//
// There are three main mechanisms at work to prevent this rounding from going
// too badly. First, for normal non-path payments, `exchangeV10` ensures that
// rounding error does not exceed 1% of the exchange; if it does the exchange
// simply fails. Second, for path payments the amount of rounding error is
// unlimited in favor of offers in the book at point of evaluating each
// exchange, but the transaction as a whole has a payment limit in terms of the
// sent asset and if that is exceeded then again the transaction will fail. And
// finally, the entire set of algorithms surrounding the choice of price and
// assignment of benefit from rounding was designed to be _fair_ to both
// participants: to alternate rounding benefit between transacting parties (as
// with price advantage), and only penalize each offer once (when it is executed
// and removed). See CAP-0004 for details.
//
//
// Final orientation notes
// -----------------------
//
// All the code in the OfferExchange is written from the perspective of
// submitting a bid to buy wheat for sheep, which is equivalent to an offer to
// sell sheep for wheat: the top stack in the diagram above. The offers it
// _queries_ in the database and potentially _crosses_ are those that are
// offering to sell wheat: the bottom stack in the diagram above. This is
// reflected in variable names: numWheatReceived and numSheepSent, for
// example. The sheep are being "sent away from us" and the wheat is being
// "received to us". Us being the sheep-seller.
//
// Terminology-wise, many of the functions use the term "stay", as in
// "wheatStays". This refers not to the metaphor of exchanging wheat or sheep,
// but rather which residual _offer_ (of a pair of crossing offers) gets written
// into the book at the end of the exchange. When "wheatStays" is true, it means
// the offer for wheat will be the one with the residue written into the book.
//
// (Further mnemonic: call stack grows down. We're starting from the top
// sheep-seller perspective and trying to extend an offer that crosses into the
// wheat-seller offers)
