// exchangeV10 is a system for crossing offers that provides guarantees
// regarding the direction and magnitude of rounding errors:
// - When considering two crossing offers subject to a variety of limits,
//   exchangeV10 has a consistent approach to determining which offer is larger.
//   The smaller offer is always removed from the book.
// - When two offers cross, the rounding error will favor the offer that remains
//   in the book.
// - The rounding error will not favor either party by more than 1% (except in
//   the case of path payment, where the rounding error can favor the offer in
//   the book by an arbitrary amount). If the rounding error would exceed 1%,
//   no trade occurs and the smaller offer is removed.
//
// As mentioned above, exchangeV10 retains the same guarantees when it is used
// to perform path payment except that the rounding error can favor the offer in
// the book by an arbitrary amount. This behavior is required in order to
// guarantee that, if the amount offered in the book exceeds maxWheatReceive
// after every offer is adjusted, then exchangeV10 will satisfy the constraint
// imposed by path payment of wheatReceive == maxWheatReceive. We note that this
// behavior is acceptable because path payment uses maxSend to determine whether
// the operation should succeed given the final effective price. If excessive
// rounding occurs, then path payment will fail because maxSend was exceeded.
//
// The quantities wheatValue and sheepValue play a central role in this function
// so it is worth discussing their significance. If we were working in arbitrary
// precision arithmetic, we would find that the value of the wheat offer in
// terms of sheep is
//     wheatOfferInTermsOfSheep = min(maxWheatSend * price, maxSheepReceive)
// and the size of the sheep offer in terms of sheep is
//     sheepOfferInTermsOfSheep = min(maxWheatReceive * price, maxSheepSend)
// Then we can see that the wheat offer is larger than the sheep offer if
//     wheatOfferInTermsOfSheep > sheepOfferInTermsOfSheep
// We are not, however, working in arbitrary precision arithmetic so we proceed
// by multiplying by price.d which yields
//     wheatOfferInTermsOfSheep * price.d
//         = min(maxWheatSend * price.n, maxSheepReceive * price.d)
//         = wheatValue
// and
//     sheepOfferInTermsOfSheep * price.d
//         = min(maxWheatReceive * price.n, maxSheepSend * price.d)
//         = sheepValue
// where both wheatValue and sheepValue are now integers. Clearly it is
// equivalent to say that the wheat offer is larger than the sheep offer if
//     wheatValue > sheepValue
// From this analysis, wheatValue can be thought of as the rescaled size of the
// wheat offer in terms of sheep after considering all limits. Analogously,
// sheepValue can be thought of as the rescaled size of the sheep offer in terms
// of sheep after considering all limits.

//         <= sheepSend / (sheepSend * price.d / price.n)
//         = price.n / price.d
// so in this case the seller of sheep is favored.
//
// If round == PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE ------------------------------------
// We first consider the case wheatStays. In this case, we guarantee that the
// effective price favors wheat
//     sheepSend / wheatReceive >= price.n / price.d
// Path payment can only succeed if, after the last offer is crossed,
// wheatReceive == maxWheatReceive. Because wheatStays, we know that this is the
// last offer that will be crossed. Then if we are to satisfy both constraints,
// it is necessary that
//     sheepSend / maxWheatReceive >= price.n / price.d
// which is equivalent to
//     sheepSend * price.d >= maxWheatReceive * price.n
// But sheepSend <= maxSheepSend, so this can only be satisfied if
//     maxSheepSend * price.d >= maxWheatReceive * price.n             (*)
// If this constraint is not satisfied, then the operation must fail.
//
// We will now show that the case (wheatStays && price.n > price.d) along with
// the constraint (*) guarantees that wheatReceive == maxWheatReceive. In this
// case we have
//     sheepValue = maxWheatReceive * price.n
// so
//     wheatReceive = floor(sheepValue / price.n)
//                  = maxWheatReceive
// and
//     sheepSend = ceil(wheatReceive * price.n / price.d)
//                = ceil(maxWheatReceive * price.n / price.d)
// Clearly the operation succeeds.
//
// We will next show that if wheatReceive == maxWheatReceive in the case
// (wheatStays && price.n <= price.d) then
//     sheepSend = ceil(maxWheatReceive * price.n / price.d)
// so the outcome is unchanged from (wheatStays && price.n > price.d). Note that
// the constraint (*) is satisfied since it is a necessary condition to have
// wheatReceive == maxWheatReceive. Then
//     sheepValue = maxWheatReceive * price.n
// so
//     sheepSend = floor(sheepValue / price.d)
//               = floor(maxWheatReceive * price.n / price.d)
// which is equivalent to
//     maxWheatReceive * price.n / price.d - 1 < sheepSend
//         <= maxWheatReceive * price.n / price.d
// Furthermore, we have
//     maxWheatReceive = floor(sheepSend * price.d / price.n)
// which is equivalent to
//     maxWheatReceive <= sheepSend * price.d / price.n < maxWheatReceive + 1
//     maxWheatReceive * price.n / price.d <= sheepSend
//         < (maxWheatReceive + 1) * price.n / price.d
// Combining the above inequalities, we find
//     maxWheatReceive * price.n / price.d <= sheepSend
//         <= maxWheatReceive * price.n / price.d
// so clearly we have
//     sheepSend = maxWheatReceive * price.n / price.d
// But sheepSend is an integer, so
//     sheepSend = ceil(sheepSend)
//               = ceil(maxWheatReceive * price.n / price.d)
// which completes this argument.
//
// Now we come to the reason that when wheatStays we handle all cases the same
// regardless of the price. The previous argument showed that the two cases are
// identical when wheatReceive == maxWheatReceive. But it is possible in the
// case (wheatStays && price.n <= price.d) that wheatReceive < maxWheatReceive.
// Consider the case
//     price = 2/3
//     maxWheatSend = 150
//     maxWheatReceive = 101
//     maxSheepSend = INT64_MAX
//     maxSheepReceive = INT64_MAX
//     round = PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE
// so
//     wheatValue = min(2 * 150, 3 * INT64_MAX) = 300
//     sheepValue = min(3 * INT64_MAX, 2 * 101) = 202
// which implies (wheatStays && price.n <= price.d). Then
//     sheepSend = floor(sheepValue / price.d)
//               = floor(202 / 3) = 67
//     wheatReceive = floor(sheepSend * price.d / price.n)
//                  = floor(67 * 3 / 2) = 100
// and clearly wheatReceive == 100 != 101 == maxWheatReceive.
//
// At this point we have determined what must occur if wheatStays but have not
// addressed the case !wheatStays. If wheatReceive = maxWheatReceive, then the
// operation succeeds. Otherwise, if sheepSend = maxSheepSend then the operation
// fails. If wheatReceive < maxWheatReceive and sheepSend < maxSheepSend, then
// the operation will cross additional offers since !wheatStays.
//
// If round == PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND ---------------------------------------

//     sheepSend = min(maxSheepSend, maxSheepReceive)
// Therefore if maxSheepSend > maxSheepReceive then the operation must fail. Now

//         >= maxSheepReceive * price.n / (maxSheepReceive * price.d)
//         = price.n / price.d
// so in this case the seller of wheat is favored.
//
// Suppose that wheatReceive < maxWheatReceive. This implies that

//     maxSheepReceive <= maxSheepSend

//     wheatValue <= maxSheepReceive * price.d
//                <= maxSheepSend * price.d
//                = sheepValue
// which contradicts the assumption that wheatStays. We claim that wheatReceive
// is the maximum amount of wheat that could be received without favoring the
// seller of sheep. To see this, observe that
//     sheepSend / (wheatReceive + 1)
//         = maxSheepSend / (floor(sheepValue / price.n) + 1)
//         = maxSheepSend / (floor(maxSheepSend * price.d / price.n) + 1)
//         <= maxSheepSend / ceil(maxSheepSend * price.d / price.n)
//         <= maxSheepSend / (maxSheepSend * price.d / price.n)
//         <= price.n / price.d
// Now for any integer K >= 1 we must have
//     sheepSend / (wheatReceive + K)
//         <= sheepSend / (wheatReceive + 1)
//         <= price.n / price.d
// which proves the claim.
//
// At this point we have determined what must occur if wheatStays but have not
// addressed the case !wheatStays. If sheepSend = maxSheepSend, then the
// operation succeeds. Otherwise, if wheatReceive = maxWheatReceive then the
// operation fails. If sheepSend < maxSheepSend and wheatReceive <
// maxWheatReceive, then the operation will cross additional offers since
// !wheatStays.

// will prove that for rounding modes NORMAL and PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE,
// wheatReceive == 0 if and only if sheepSend == 0. We will also prove that for
// rounding mode PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND, sheepSend > 0 is guaranteed.
//
// We first address the case (!wheatStays && price.n > price.d). Then it follows
// from wheatReceive = 0 that
//     sheepSend = floor(wheatReceive * price.n / price.d)
// so sheepSend = 0. Similarly, if sheepSend = 0 then

//               >= floor(wheatReceive)
//               = wheatReceive
// so 0 <= wheatReceive <= 0 implies wheatReceive = 0.
//
// Similarly, we investigate when (!wheatStays && price.n <= price.d). Then it
// follows from sheepSend = 0 that
//     wheatReceive = ceil(sheepSend * price.d / price.n)
// so wheatReceive = 0. Similarly, if wheatReceive = 0 then
//     wheatReceive = ceil(sheepSend * price.d / price.n)
//                  >= ceil(sheepSend)
//                  = sheepSend
// so 0 <= sheepSend <= 0 implies sheepSend = 0.
//
// These first two results hold regardless of the rounding mode.
//
// If round == NORMAL ---------------------------------------------------------
// We turn our attention to the case (wheatStays && price.n > price.d). Then it
// follows from wheatReceive = 0 that
//     sheepSend = ceil(wheatReceive * price.n / price.d)
// so sheepSend = 0. Similarly, if sheepSend = 0 then
//     sheepSend = ceil(wheatReceive * price.n / price.d)
//               >= ceil(wheatReceive)
//               = wheatReceive
// so 0 <= wheatReceive <= 0 implies wheatReceive = 0.
//
// Next consider the case (wheatStays && price.n <= price.d). Then it follows
// from sheepSend = 0 that
//     wheatReceive = floor(sheepSend * price.d / price.n)
// so wheatReceive = 0. Similarly, if wheatReceive = 0 then
//     wheatReceive = floor(sheepSend * price.d / price.n)
//                  >= floor(sheepSend)
//                  = sheepSend
// so 0 <= sheepSend <= 0 implies sheepSend = 0.
//
// If round == PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE ------------------------------------
// The case (wheatStays && price.n > price.d) is identical to the analogous case
// when round == NORMAL.
//
// We now consider the case (wheatStays && price.n <= price.d). Then it follows
// from wheatReceive = 0 that
//     sheepSend = ceil(wheatReceive * price.n / price.d)
// so sheepSend = 0. Similarly, if sheepSend = 0 then
//     sheepSend = ceil(wheatReceive * price.n / price.d)
//               >= ceil(wheatReceive * 1 / INT32_MAX)
//               = ceil(wheatReceive / INT32_MAX)
// Suppose that wheatReceive > 0. Then
//     sheepSend >= ceil(1 / INT32_MAX) = 1
// which is a contradiction, so 0 <= wheatReceive <= 0 implies wheatReceive = 0.
//
// If round == PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND ---------------------------------------
// Finally, we address the more complicated case (wheatStays). Suppose that we
// have sheepSend = 0. Then clearly maxSheepSend = 0 or maxSheepReceive = 0. But
// if maxSheepSend = 0, then we should have already stopped crossing offers
// because no more can be sent. Similarly if maxSheepReceive = 0, then the offer
// should have already been removed from the order book because no more can be
// received. In either case, we have reached a contradiction because we would
// not be crossing in either case. We conclude that sheepSend > 0.
