    // checkpoint, skipping the history log that happened between the last
    // closed ledger and the catchup point. This is set by config, default is
    // CATCHUP_MINIMAL but it should be CATCHUP_COMPLETE for any server with
    // API clients. See LedgerManager::startCatchUp and its callers for uses.

    // to download and apply history without joining to SCP. It can be called by
