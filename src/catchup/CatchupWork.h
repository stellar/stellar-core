// for the first.first() and then downloading and applying transactions.
//
// If second is false, this catchup requires downloading and applying
// transactions for whole range of ledgers.
//
// When (first.first() == first.last()) && second this is equivalent to old
// CATCHUP_MIMIMAL.
//
// For old CATCHUP_COMPLETE second is always false, as CATCHUP_COMPLETE only
// applies transactions.
//
// For old CATCHUP_RECENT value of second depends on value of last closed
// ledger - if CATCHUP_RECENT would go before it, it behaves exactly as
// CATCHUP_COMPLETE. If not, second is true and miminal catchup will be done
// first.

// CatchupWork does all the neccessary work to perform any type of catchup.
// It accepts CatchupConfiguration structure to know from which ledger to which
// one do the catchup and if it involves only applying ledgers or ledgers and
// buckets.
//
// First thing it does is to get a history state which allows to calculate
// proper destination ledger (in case CatchupConfiguration::CURRENT) was used
// and to get list of buckets that should be in database on that ledger.
//
// Next step is downloading and verifying ledgers (if verifyMode is set to
// VERIFY_BUFFERED_LEDGERS it can also verify against ledgers currently
// buffered in LedgerManager).
//
// Then, depending on configuration, it can download, verify and apply buckets
// (as in MINIMAL and RECENT catchups), and then download and apply
// transactions (as in COMPLETE and RECENT catchups).
//
// After that, catchup is done and node can replay buffered ledgers and take
// part in consensus protocol.
