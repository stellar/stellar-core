# This copy of the soroban host is always enabled, and should always point to a
# version that supports stellar-core's Config::CURRENT_LEDGER_PROTOCOL_VERSION.
# When upgrading from protocol N to N+1, this copy will therefore have its
# version advance first (to enable support for N+1) even before the network has
# voted to upgrade to it. In order to avoid divergence during such an upgrade,
# we will simultaneously enable the `prev` copy of soroban (below), continuing
# to point to the previous already-released soroban that only supported protocol
# N.

# This copy of the soroban host is _optional_ and only enabled during protocol
# transitions. When transitioning from protocol N to N+1, the `curr` copy
# (above) will bump its version to one that supports protocol N+1, and we will
# simultaneously enable this `prev` copy by building with
# `--feature=soroban-env-host-prev` and pointing its version and git rev to the
# last soroban released to the network that speaks protocol N. When we deploy
# this to a network running protocol N it will run on `prev` until the upgrade,
# then switch from `prev` to `curr` at the upgrade, and then in the next release
# we can turn `prev` off again.
#
# A note on `rev` hashes: When `prev` is disabled, the rust-analyzer IDE will
# still want it to point to some version of soroban just for auto-completion
# (because it builds with `--all-features`). To make this work, the `rev` spec
# below has to be different from the `rev` spec in the `curr` copy of soroban
# above. The easiest way to make this work is to just point to one git rev 
# before the rev specified for `curr`.
