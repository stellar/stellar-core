/**
 * LedgerManager maintains, in memory, a logical pair of ledgers:
 *
 *     1. The "current ledger", to which the transactions currently accumulating
 *        in memory (in the Herder) will be applied on the next ledger-close.
 *
 *     2. The "last-closed ledger" (LCL), which is the result of the most recent
 *        ledger-close. This ledger is the state most recently committed to the
 *        SQL store, is immutable, and is the basis for the transactions applied
 *        in "current". In other words, "current" begins as a copy of LCL and
 *        then is mutated by the transactions applied to it.
 *
 * LedgerManager also coordinates the incremental advance of these ledgers: the
 * process of closing ledgers, turning the current ledger into the next LCL, and
 * producing a new current ledger.
 *
 * Finally, LedgerManager triggers and responds to boundary conditions in the
 * life cycle of the application that "suddenly" alter the notions of "current"
 * and "LCL": process startup, desynchronization and resynchronization of the
 * current process with the rest of the network.
