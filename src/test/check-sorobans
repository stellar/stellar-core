# very often since there's CI on the soroban repos, but it's still possible that
# the soroban CI ran on a different rust compiler / stdlib version than
# stellar-core was built with, and the fine-grained "observations" stored in the
# soroban repos are worth re-checking.

# Define tests to skip
# `test_expected_size` tests the actual memory sizes of types used in memory metering.
# This test is skipped because memory sizes vary based on Rust compiler version and 
# system architecture. This test is primarily used during development to calibrate 
# our declared sizes, which are what's actually used in production for deterministic 
# memory metering.
