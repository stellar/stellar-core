/**
 * TransactionQueue keeps received transactions that are valid and have not yet
 * been included in a transaction set.
 *
 * An accountID is in mAccountStates if and only if it is the fee-source or
 * sequence-number-source for at least one transaction in the TransactionQueue.
 * This invariant is maintained by releaseFeeMaybeEraseAccountState.
 *
 * Transactions received from the HTTP "tx" endpoint and the overlay network
 * should be added by calling tryAdd. If that succeeds, the transaction may be
 * removed later in three ways:
 * - removeApplied() should be called after transactions are applied. It removes
 *   the specified transactions, but leaves transactions with subsequent
 *   sequence numbers in the TransactionQueue. It also resets the age for the
 *   sequence-number-source of each specified transaction.
 * - ban() should be called after transactions become invalid for any reason.
 *   Banned transactions cannot be added to the TransactionQueue again for a
 *   banDepth ledgers.
 * - shift() should be called after each ledger close, after removeApplied. It
 *   increases the age for every account that is the sequence-number-source for
 *   at least one transaction. If the age becomes greater than or equal to
 *   pendingDepth, all transactions for that source account are banned. It also
 *   unbans any transactions that have been banned for more than banDepth
 *   ledgers.
