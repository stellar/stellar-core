//
// There's a fair bit of ground to cover in understanding what this algorithm is
// doing and convincing you, reader, that it's correct (as I had to convince
// myself). I've therefore (re)written it in as plain and explicit (and maybe
// over-verbose) a style as possible, to be as expository and convincing, as
// well as including this gruesomely long comment to guide you in
// reading. Please don't add anything clever unless you've got a very good
// performance reason, and even then make sure you add docs explaining what
// you've done.
//
//
// Definitions
// ===========
//
// - A network N is a set of nodes {N₀, N₁, ...}
//
// - Every node Nᵢ has an associated quorum set (or "qset") QSᵢ that is a set of
//   subsets of N.
//
// - Every element of a qset QSᵢ is called a quorum slice.
//
// - A quorum Q ⊆ N is a set satisfying: Q ≠ ∅ and Ɐ Nᵢ ∈ Q, ∃ S ∈ QSᵢ, S ⊆ Q
//
// - Equivalently in english: a quorum is a subset of the network such that for
//   each node Nᵢ in the quorum, there's some slice S in the node's quorum set
//   QSᵢ that is itself (S) also a subset of the quorum. In this case we also
//   say the quorum "contains a slice for Nᵢ" or "satisfies QSᵢ" or "satisfies
//   Nᵢ". Note that this definition is not always satisfiable: many networks
//   have no quorums.
//
// - A network N "enjoys quorum intersection" if every pair of quorums
//   intersects in at least a single node.
//
// - A minimal quorum (or min-quorum or minq) is a quorum that does not have any
//   quorum as a proper subset.
//
// - A network N and its quorum sets induce a directed graph Gₙ, in which the
//   vertices are the nodes of the network and an edge exists between any node
//   Nᵢ and Nⱼ when Nⱼ is in one of the quorum slices in QSᵢ. In other words,
//   the graph has an edge for every dependency between a node and a member
//   of one of its quorum slices.
//
// - A strongly connected component is a subset C of a network in which every
//   pair of nodes Nᵢ and Nⱼ ∈ C can reach each other by following edges Gₙ.
//
//
// Intuition
// =========
//
// We will build up an algorithm for checking quorum intersection one step at
// a time.
//
// First: assume we have as a building block the ability to check a set of nodes
// for being-a-quorum. This part isn't hard and there's code implementing it
// below (QuorumIntersectionChecker::isAQuorum, though it's impelmented in terms
// of refinement 2 so don't read ahead just yet, just trust me).
//
// We could check quorum intersection for a network N via a loop like this:
//
//  foreach subset S₁ of N:
//    if S₁ is a quorum:
//      foreach subset S₂ of N:
//        if S₂ is a quorum:
//          check S₁∩ S₂≠ ∅
//
// And that would clearly suffice! It's practically the definition, rewritten in
// code, and in fact this is how we initially wrote quorum intersection
// checking. The only problem is that it is very slow: it enumerates the
// powerset P(N) of all subsets of the network, and even does so again, in a
// nested loop. This means it takes O(2ⁿ)² time. Bad.
//
// But the intuition is fine and the algorithm we wind up with is "just" a lot
// of refinements to that intuition. We're going to explore conceptually the
// same search space, just with a bunch of simplifying assumptions that let us
// skip most of it because we've convinced ourselves there are no "hits" in the
// parts we skip.
//
//
// Refinement 1: Switch to checking the complement
// ===============================================
//
// The nested testing and intersection loop above can be rewritten the following
// way while preserving logical equivalence:
//
// foreach subset S₁ of N:
//   if S₁ is a quorum:
//     for each subset S₂ of N \ S₁:
//       check that S₂ is not a quorum
//
// That is, any subset S₂ of the complement of S₁ is (by definition)
// non-intersecting with S₁ and therefore needs to be not-a-quorum if we want to
// enjoy quorum intersection. This will go a bit faster than the full cartesian
// product space of the first algorithm because as S₁ expands, N \ S₁ contracts,
// but the real improvement in complexity shows up if we introduce another
// building block (which is in fact how we implement isAQuorum anyways).
//
//
// Refinement 2: Switch to contracting sets to maximal quorums
// ===========================================================
//
// Given some set S ⊆ N, we can contract S to a maximal quorum Q ⊆ S (if it
// exists) in reasonably quick time: for each node Nᵢ ∈ S, remove Nᵢ from S if S
// does not satisfy QSᵢ, and keep iterating this procedure until it reaches a
// fixpoint. The fixpoint will either be empty (in which case S contained no
// quorum) or the largest quorum contained within S. This runs in time linear
// with the size of S (times at-worst linear-time slice checking, so maybe
// quadratic; but still far better than the exponential time of the powerset!)
//
// Where this is useful is that the algorithm from refinement 1 can now be
// adapted to seek quorums directly in the complement, rather than enumerating
// subsets of the complement:
//
// foreach subset S₁ of N:
//   if S₁ is a quorum:
//     check that (N \ S₁) contracts to the empty set (i.e. has no quorum)
//
// This frees us from the cartesian product of the powersets. Good! But we're
// still exploring the powerset in the outer loop.
//
//
// Refinement 3: Enumerate from bottom up
// ======================================
//
// We haven't mentioned yet specifically how we're going to enumerate the
// powerset P(N), and it turns out one order is especially useful for our
// purposes: "bottom up", starting from 1-element sets and expanding to
// 2-element sets, then 3-element sets, and so forth.
//
// In particular we're going to pick a recursive enumeration that's based on two
// sets: C (for "committed") and R (for "remaining"). We start with C = ∅ and R
// = N. The set C at each call is the current set we're expanding, bottom-up;
// the set R is the set we're going to draw expansions from. We pass C and R to
// the following recursive enumerator:
//
//     def enumerate(C, R):
//         fail if C is a quorum and (N \ C) has a quorum
//         return if R = ∅
//         pick some node Nᵢ ∈ R
//         call enumerate(C, R \ {Nᵢ})
//         call enumerate(C ∪ {Nᵢ}, R \ {Nᵢ})
//
// Any activation of this procedure is logically enumerating the powerset of
// some "perimeter set" P = C ∪ R (initially = N), but it's doing so by
// recursively dividing the perimeter in two: picking some arbitrary Nᵢ in R,
// and in the first recursive call enumerating the subsets of P that exclude Nᵢ,
// then in the second recursive call enumerating the subsets of P that include
// Nᵢ.
//
// The reason this order is useful is that it organizes the search into a
// branching tree of recursive calls that each tell us enough about their
// pending callees that we can trim some branches of that tree without actually
// calling them. The next several refinements are adding such "early exits",
// that trim the search tree.
//
//
// Refinement 4: Only scan half the space (early exit #1)
// ======================================================
//
// The first early exit is easy: just stop expanding when you get half-way
// through the space (or precisely: at sets larger than MAXSZ = #N/2)
// because the problem is symmetric: any potential failing subset C with size
// greater than MAXSZ discovered in the branching subtree ahead will satisfy
//
//     C is a quorum and (N \ C) has a quorum
//
// and if such a C exists, it will also be discovered by some other branch of
// the search tree scanning the complement, that is enumerating subsets of
// (N \ C) which has size less than MAXSZ. So there's no point looking at the
// bigger-than-half subsets in detail. So we add an exit:
//
//     def enumerate(C, R):
//         return if #C > MAXSZ                              ← new early exit
//         fail if C is a quorum and (N \ C) has a quorum
//         return if R = ∅
//         pick some node Nᵢ ∈ R
//         call enumerate(C, R \ {Nᵢ})
//         call enumerate(C ∪ {Nᵢ}, R \ {Nᵢ})
//
//
// Refinement 5: Look ahead for possible quorums (early exit #2.1 and 2.2)
// =======================================================================
//
// The second early exit is similarly simple: after we've checked C for quorum
// and before recursing into the next two branches, look at the "perimeter set"
// P = C ∪ R that defines the space in which the two branches will be exploring
// and check (using the contraction function) to see if there are any quorums in
// that space at all. And even more specifically, if any such (maximal) quorum
// is an extension (superset-or-equal) of C, since it will need to be if we're
// going to enumerate it in either of the remaining branches.
//
// If not, there's no point searching for specific quorums and their
// complements, and we can return early. We add the following early exits:
//
//     def enumerate(C, R):
//         return if #C > MAXSZ
//         fail if C is a quorum and (N \ C) has a quorum
//         return if R = ∅
//         return if (C ∪ R) has no quorum or                ← new early exits
//             its maximal quorum isn't a superset of C
//         pick some node Nᵢ ∈ R
//         call enumerate(C, R \ {Nᵢ})
//         call enumerate(C ∪ {Nᵢ}, R \ {Nᵢ})
//
//
// Refinement 6: Minimal quorums only (early exits #3.1 and 3.2)
// =============================================================
//
// So far we've been treating all quorums as equally concerning, but there is a
// key relationship we can exploit when exploring the powerset bottom-up:
// that some quorums are contained inside of other quorums.
//
// It turns out that a quorum that does not contain other quorums – a so-called
// min-quorum or minq – is sufficiently powerful to serve as a sort of
// boundary for trimming the search space. In particular, this
// possibly-surprising theorem holds:
//
//     A network enjoys quorum intersection iff every pair of minqs intersects.
//
// That is, we can redefine (while preserving equivalence) the enumeration task
// from full quorums and their complements to minqs and their complements, which
// (as we'll see) gives us another early exit. First we need to prove this
// theorem.
//
//     Forward implication: trivial. Quorum intersection is defined as "any two
//     quorums intersect". Two minqs are quorums, so they intersect by
//     assumption.
//
//     Reverse implication: by contradiction. Assume all pairs of minqs
//     intersect but some pair of quorums Q1 and Q2 do not intersect. Q1 and Q2
//     may or may not be minqs themselves, so 4 cases that all end with subsets
//     of Q1 intersecting Q2, contradicting assumption:
//
//       - If Q1 and Q2 are minqs, they intersect by assumption.
//
//       - (Two symmetric cases) If Qi is a minq and Qj is not for i != j, Qj
//         has a minq Mj inside itself (by definition of being a non-minq) and
//         Mj intersects Qi by assumption that all minqs intersect.
//
//       - If neither is a minq then each contain minqs M1 and M2 and those
//         intersect by assumption.
//
// So what is this good for? If we treat our problem as searching for minqs
// rather than more general quorums, we can do an early return in the
// enumeration any time we encounter any quorum at all: we're growing bottom-up
// from sets to supersets, but no superset of a quorum is a minq, so once we're
// at a committed set C that's a quorum there's no need to look in any further
// sub-branches of the search enlarging C: there are no more minqs down those
// branches.
//
// So we test for quorum-ness, and then for minq-ness (checking the
// complement for a non-intersecting quorum if so), and then return early in
// either case:
//
//     def enumerate(C, R):
//         return if #C > MAXSZ
//         if C is a quorum:
//             fail if C is a minq and (N \ C) has a quorum
//             return                                         ← new early exit
//         return if R = ∅
//         return if (C ∪ R) has no quorum or
//             its maximal quorum isn't a superset of C
//         pick some node Nᵢ ∈ R
//         call enumerate(C, R \ {Nᵢ})
//         call enumerate(C ∪ {Nᵢ}, R \ {Nᵢ})
//
//
// Refinement 7: heuristic node selection
// ======================================
//
// Observe above that we pick "some node Nᵢ ∈ R" but don't say how. It turns out
// that the node we choose has a dramatic effect on the amount of search space
// explored. Picking right means we get to an early exit (or failure) ASAP;
// picking wrong means we double the search without hitting any early exits in
// the next layer of the recursion.
//
// There's no good single answer for the best next-node to divide on; probably
// knowing this would be equivalent to solving the problem anyways. But we can
// use some heuristics. I've explored several and not come up with any better
// (empirically) than in Lachowski's initial code, so we stick with that
// heuristic here: we pick the node with the highest indegree, when looking at
// the subgraph of the remaining nodes R and edges between them. If there are
// multiple such nodes we pick among them randomly. This seems to favor
// discovering participants in quorums early, taking the quorum-related early
// exits ASAP.
//
//
// Refinement 8: Time for some graph theory
// ========================================
//
// There is one last step in the development here and it also involves minqs but
// not early exits in the enumeration as such. The enumerate function above is
// left alone, but we reduce the inputs to it from minqs in P(N) to minqs in
// P(M) for some M ⊆ N, reducing our search a lot. For this we need graph
// theory!
//
// The trick here is to recognize that there's a relationship between minqs and
// strongly connected components (SCCs) in the induced directed graph
// Gₙ. Specifically that the following theorem holds:
//
//     Any minq of N is entirely contained in an SCC of the induced graph Gₙ.
//
// Again it's worth pausing to prove by contradiction:
//
//     If some minq Q of N extended beyond an SCC of Gₙ, that means
//     (definitionally) that Q contains some node Nᵢ that depends on some node
//     Nⱼ that is not in the same SCC as Nᵢ. Since Q is a quorum, Q satisfies Nⱼ
//     by means of some slice SLⱼ ⊆ Q. Since Nⱼ is not in the same SCC as Nᵢ,
//     this SLⱼ must also not depend on nodes in the same SCC as Nᵢ. But if
//     that's so, then Nⱼ and SLⱼ together make up a subquorum of Q,
//     contradicting the assumption that Q is minimal.
//
// What's useful about the SCC relationship is that it means we can add a
// pre-filtering stage that analyzes Gₙ rather than P(N) and does two helpful
// things:
//
//     1. Check that only one SCC of Gₙ has quorums in it at all. If there are
//        two, then they contain a pair of disjoint minqs, and we're done
//        (quorum intersection does not hold).
//
//     2. Reduce the enumeration task to the powerset of the nodes of the SCC
//        that has quorums in it, rather than the powerset of all the nodes in
//        the graph. This typically excludes lots of nodes.
//
//
// Coda: micro-optimizations
// =========================
//
// We've finished with algorithmic improvements. All that remains is making it
// go as fast as possible. For this, we use graph and set representations that
// minimize allocation, hashing, indirection and so forth: vectors of dense
// bitsets and bitwise operations. These are not the same representations used
// elsewhere in stellar-core so there's a little work up front converting
// representations.
//
// Remaining details of the implementation are noted as we go, but the above
// explanation ought to give you a good idea what you're looking at.
