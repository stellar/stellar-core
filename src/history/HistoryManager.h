/**
 * The history module is responsible for storing and retrieving "historical
 * records" in longer-term (public, internet) archives. These records take two
 * forms:
 *
 *   1. Buckets from the BucketList -- checkpoints of "full ledger state".
 *   2. History blocks -- a sequential log of ledger headers and transactions,
 *      stored as separate ledger and transaction files.
 *
 * The module design attempts to satisfy several key constraints:
 *
 *   - Simplicity. Historical records must be simple enough that multiple
 *     implementations can digest them. The formats and protocols employed
 *     should be simple enough that they will have longevity and resistance
 *     to implementation idiosyncrasies and bugs. The interface to the
 *     history system should be simple enough that multiple backends can
 *     implement it.
 *
 *   - Public transparency. History should be stored in ways that permit
 *     3rd parties to access/mirror them completely, efficiently and easily,
 *     preferably without asking permission or consuming server resources.
 *
 *   - Resource efficiency. History should not consume unreasonable amounts of
 *     space. It should be practical to store truncated partial histories. It
 *     should employ large-chunk-size bulk transport over commodity bulk file
 *     service protocols whenever possible. It should be write-once and permit
 *     old / cold files to be moved to increasingly cheap (eg. glacier) storage
 *     or deleted using server-side expiration/archival policies.
 *
 *   - Tolerable latency for two main scenarios: "new peer joins network"
 *     and "peer temporarily de-synchronized, needs to catch up".
 *
 * The history store is served to clients over HTTP. In the root of the history
 * store is a history archive state file (class HistoryArchiveState) which
 * stores the most recent checkpoint (including version info, most recent ledger
 * number and most recent bucket hashes). As per RFC 5785, this checkpoint is
 * stored at .well-known/stellar-history.json as a JSON file.
 *
 * Checkpoints are made every 64 ledgers, which (at 5s ledger close time) is
 * 320s or about 5m20s. There will be 11 checkpoints per hour, 270 per day, and
 * 98,550 per year. Counting checkpoints within a 32bit value gives 43,581 years
 * of service for the system.
 *
 * While the _most recent_ checkpoint is in .well-known/stellar-history.json,
 * each checkpoint is also stored permanently at a path whose name includes the
 * last ledger number in the checkpoint (as a 32-bit hex string) and stored in a
 * 3-level deep directory tree of hex digit prefixes. For example, checkpoint at
 * current ledger-number 0x12345678 will write ledgers up to and including
 * ledger 0x12345677 and be described by file
 * history/12/34/56/history-0x12345677.json and the associated history block
 * will be written to the two files ledger/12/34/56/ledger-0x12345677.xdr.gz and
 * transaction/12/34/56/transaction-0x12345677.xdr.gz
 *
 * Bucket files accompanying each checkpoint are stored by hash name, again
 * separated by 3-level-deep hex prefixing, though as the hash is unpredictable,
 * the directories will fill up in unpredictable order, not sequentially: if the
 * bucket's hex hash is <AABBCCDEFG...> then the bucket is stored as
 * bucket/AA/BB/CC/bucket-<AABBCCDEFG...>.xdr.gz
 *
 * The first ledger and transaction files (containing the genesis ledger #1, and
 * the subsequent 62 ledgers) are checkpointed when LedgerManager's
 * currentLedger is 64 = 0x40, so the last ledger published into that snapshot
 * is 0x3f, and it's stored in files ledger/00/00/00/ledger-0x0000003f.xdr.gz
 * and transaction/00/00/00/transaction-0x0000003f.xdr.gz, and described by
 * history/00/00/00/history-0x0000003f.json.
 *
 * A pseudo-checkpoint describing the system-state before any transactions are
 * applied -- the fictional "ledger zero" state -- is also made in each history
 * archive when it is initialized. This is described by
 * history/00/00/00/history-0x00000000.json, with all-zero buckets. No
 * transaction or ledger-history XDR files are associated with this
 * pseudo-checkpoint; its presence simply indicates that the archive has been
 * initialized, and gives the catchup system something to read when it probes
 * the archive for a most-recent state.
 *
 *
 * Boundary conditions and counts:
 * -------------------------------
 *
 * There is no ledger 0 -- that's the sequence number of a _fictional_ ledger
 * with no content, before "ledger 1, the genesis ledger" -- so the initial
 * ledger block (block 0x0000003f) has 63 "real" ledger objects in it, not 64 as
 * in all subsequent blocks. We could, instead, shift all arithmetic in the
 * system to "count from 1" and have ledger blocks run from [1,64] and [65,128]
 * and so forth; but the disadvantages of propagating counts-from-1 arithmetic
 * all through the system seem worse than the disadvantage of having to
 * special-case the first history block, so we stick with "counting from 0" for
 * now. So all ledger blocks _start on_ a multiple of 64 and run until
 * one-less-than the next multiple of 64, inclusive: [0,63], [64,127],
 * [128,191], etc.
 *
 *
 * The catchup algorithm:
 * ----------------------
 *
 * When catching up, it's useful to denote the ledgers involved symbolically.
 * Consider the following timeline:
 *
 *
 *       [==========|.......|========|=======|......]
 *    GENESIS     LAST    RESUME   INIT    NEXT    TIP
 *                                   |              |
 *                                   [-- buffered --]
 *                                       (in mem)
 *
 * The network's view of time begins at ledger GENESIS and, sometime thereafter,
 * we assume this peer lost synchronization with its neighbour peers at ledger
 * LAST. Catchup is then concerned with the points that happen after then:
 * RESUME, INIT, NEXT and TIP.
 * The following explains the logic involving these 4 points:
 *
 * The desynchronized peer commences catchup at some ledger INIT, when it
 * realizes INIT > LAST+1 and that it is "out of sync". This begins "catchup
 * mode", but we expect that during catchup TIP -- the consensus view of the
 * other peers -- will continue advancing beyond INIT. The peer therefore
 * buffers new ledger-close events during catchup, as TIP advances. This set of
 * ledgers -- the segment [INIT, TIP] -- is stored in memory, in the
 * LedgerManager (::mSyncingLedgers) and extended as SCP hears of new closes,
 * until catchup is complete.
 *
 * The catchup system then rounds up from INIT to NEXT, which is the next
 * checkpoint after INIT that it can find on a history archive. It will pause
 * until it can find one; this accounts for a delay up to the duration of a
 * checkpoint (~5 minutes).
 *
 * Depending on how it's invoked, the catchup system will then usually define
 * RESUME as either equal to NEXT or LAST, or in unusual cases some ledger
 * between the two. RESUME is the ledger at which the ledger state is
 * reconstituted "directly" from the bucket list, and from which hisory blocks
 * are replayed thereafter. It is therefore, practically, a kind of "new
 * beginning of history". At least the history that will be contiguously seen
 * on-hand on this peer.
 *
 * Therefore: if the peer is serving public API consumers that expect a
 * complete, uninterrupted view of history from LAST to the present, it will
 * define RESUME=LAST and replay all history blocks since LAST. If on the other
 * hand the peer is interested in a minimal catchup and does not want to serve
 * contiguous history records to its clients, or if too much time has passed
 * since LAST for this to be reasonable, it may define RESUME=NEXT and replay
 * the absolute least history it can, probably only the stuff buffered in
 * memory during catchup.
 *
 * If RESUME=LAST, no buckets need to be downloaded and the system can simply
 * download history blocks; if RESUME=NEXT, no history blocks need to be
 * downloaded and the system it can simply download buckets. In theory the
 * system can be invoked with RESUME at some other value between LAST and NEXT
 * but in practice we expect these two modes to be the majority of uses.
 *
 * Once the blocks and/or buckets required are obtained, history is
 * reconstituted and/or replayed as required, and control calls back the
 * provided handler, with the value of NEXT as an argument. The handler should
 * then drop any ledgers <= NEXT that it has buffered, replay those ledgers
 * between NEXT and TIP exclusive, and declare itself "caught up".
