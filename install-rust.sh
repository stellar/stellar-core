# A specific version of rustup is selected for checksum stability. This install
# script is intended to continue to work even after new versions of rustup are
# released and it will continue to do so if we pin to a specific version. If we
# do not pin to a specific version the checksums will fail for previously tagged
# versions of core if the repository is cloned and this script is triggered
# either manually or via one of the Docker image build processes.

# This is the SHA256 if the rustup-init binary (which is the same as rustup --
# it renames itself) and should be retrieved from a trusted source (eg. the rust
# website and/or by running sha256sum on a local copy of rustup you believe to
# be legitimate). The canonical URL for the SHA256 checksum provided here is:
#
# https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/rustup-init.sha256
# https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/aarach64-unknown-linux-gnu/rustup-init.sha256
#
# Rustup is an installer, not the compiler, and the installer changes fairly
# rarely, often a year between releases or more. This checksum will only need
# to be updated when there's a new rustup (installer) release.
